# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Ray Images

A Deep Learning based Image Classification project to detect **Pneumonia** from Chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning techniques.

This project uses the **Labeled Chest Xray Images** dataset from Kaggle:

##  Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be detected through chest X-ray imaging. This project builds a deep learning model to classify X-ray images into:

-  NORMAL
- PNEUMONIA

The model is trained using CNN architecture and optimized using transfer learning techniques for improved accuracy.

If you want, I can also generate:

- A more **professional research-style README**
- A deployment-ready version (FastAPI + Docker)
- A version formatted for Kaggle notebook
- A version tailored for university submission

Just tell me which style you prefer.
